# Hello and Welcome! 👋🏼

My name is Aaleem and I'm a Cloud ☁ DevOps Engineer. I have over 10 years of experience in the tech field with a focus in cloud infrastructure and automation. I received my Bachelor's of Science in Information Sciences and Technology from The Pennsylvania State University in May of 2020 and I'm also an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner. I have 3 years of experience in AWS but I'm now switching gears and learning within the Microsoft Azure cloud provider.

Within this repository you will find all sorts of code coming from real world applications (minus my university projects) written by myself from start to finish.

Please reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaleemsiddiqui/) if you have any questions or feel like connecting. 
Thanks for visiting, cheers!

## About me 📝

In my leisure I love to play video games 🎮. I am an avid gamer and I can get quite competitive at times. I also like to lift weights; I go to the gym every day first thing in the morning. I am a car guy, so I like cars and I have a motorcycle as well which I like to ride when the weather is good. I play a few sports; Volleyball 🏐, Badminton 🏸, Table Tennis 🏓, and Bowling 🎳. 

Career-wise, I started working in the tech field in high school. Throughout university, I worked full-time overnight shifts. So I would go to university full-time during the week and then I would work full-time overnights towards the end of the week onto the weekend. Once I graduated, I pursued my career in the cloud industry because that is what piqued my interest. I'm a fast learner and I am always open to taking on new oppurtunities and challenges to continue learning and growing. Excellent in bringing high quality results with extensive attention to detail.
