Hello and Welcome! 

My name is Aaleem and I'm a Cloud Engineer. I received my Bachelor's of Science in Information Sciences and Technology from The Pennsylvania State University in May of 2020 and I'm also an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner. I have 9 years of experience in the technology field with a forte in automating things. Anything to save YOU some time.

Here you will find all sorts of code written by myself from start to finish. There are only a few prime examples here as I have written many different variations of the same code in different environments or for different infrastructure. 

Please reach out to me via LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaleemsiddiqui/) if you have any questions or feel like connecting. 
Thanks for visiting, cheers!
